1. To run SDMA, you can use the following command: 
    macol.exe   parameter1    
    where macol.exe is an executable file generated by SDMA ,and parameter1 denotes the name of the input file (or the name of the instance). The format of the input file should be as follows (for instance): 
   p 1000 534519
   e 2 1
   e 3 1
   e 3 2
   e 4 1
   ...
2. At the end of the running, you can get the following output:
   File_Name  K  Min_K_best  Mean_K_best  Min_Time 
   where these are important results that we will describe in detail in the following:File_Name is the the name of the input file;K denotes the number of colors;Min_K_best represents the smallest (best) number of colors found;Mean_K_best is the average number of colors;Min_Time is the shortest time  to get the minimum K.
